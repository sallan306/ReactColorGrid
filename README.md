# React Color Grid
I wanted to create a responsive grid system that could dynamically respond to user input.  This primarily uses React's Refrences capabilities, array mapping, and some grid system oriented math to respond to the nearby boxes relative to the highlighted element. This particular application changes the color, but the event triggering functionality opens up wider possibilities.
